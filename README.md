# ECE2112---ADVANCED-PROGRAMMING---PA2
This project demonstrates the use of NumPy in solving two problems:

# Normalization Problem
- Generate a random 5x5 matrix.
- Apply normalization using the formula:

        Z = X - Xˉ​/σ

where: 
   - Xˉ​ is the mean of the data.
   - σ is the standard deviation of the data.
- The normalized values are stored in a .npy file for later use.

# Divisible by 3 Problem
- Create a 10x10 matrix containing the squares of the first 100 positive integers.
- Extract all elements that are divisible by 3.
- Save the extracted elements as a .npy file.
